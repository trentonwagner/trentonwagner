## ADVANCED **ASTRONAUT TRAINING** IN TEXAS

> Travel to Johnson Space Center, Texas, and enjoy top access to NASA’s training facilities and Mission Control; experience Space Center Houston; and conduct a simulated mission to the International Space Station. Campers will build and test an underwater rover culminating in a group challenge to recover 3D printed Apollo F1 engines from the bottom of a swimming pool—all part of a simulation of the Bezos Expedition’s 2013 recovery of the F1 engines from the floor of the Atlantic ocean!

## My Take

This camp we went to Houston and saw mission control for the Apollo space missions. Our mission for this camp was much more challenging. We knew ahead of time that there was going to be a disaster during the mission, but we didn't know what it would be. During my mission, we actually had several disasters to overcome and bring the shuttle home safely.
