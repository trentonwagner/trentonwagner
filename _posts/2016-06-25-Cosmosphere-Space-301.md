## ADVANCED **ASTRONAUT TRAINING** IN TEXAS

> Travel to Johnson Space Center, Texas, and enjoy top access to NASA’s training facilities and Mission Control; experience Space Center Houston; and conduct a simulated mission to the International Space Station. Campers will build and test an underwater rover culminating in a group challenge to recover 3D printed Apollo F1 engines from the bottom of a swimming pool—all part of a simulation of the Bezos Expedition’s 2013 recovery of the F1 engines from the floor of the Atlantic ocean!

## My Take

This camp has a much more robotics in space theme. The mission had 1 aspect of us building components underwater while scuba diving. This simulated weighlessness of space. Another part of the mission was working with remote controlling the 'Canadarm', a robotic arm on the outside of the space station. We also launched rockets that we built.
