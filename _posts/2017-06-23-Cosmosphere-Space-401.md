## ADVANCED **ASTRONAUT TRAINING** IN FLORIDA

> Travel to Kennedy Space Center, Florida, for an in-depth tour of America’s spaceport; take a selfie with the space shuttle Atlantis; build a weather balloon payload and launch it miles high; tour both historic and modern spacecraft launch facilities; and visit Florida’s Cocoa Beach.

## My Take

This was my favorite space camp because we got to predict where a weather balloon would go and then launched it. We did multiple experiments while the balloon was in the stratosphere and our prediction was at the airport and the balloon landed near there. I worked on the parachute so it would land safely. We also toured the Kennedy Space Center and it was amazing! There was a real Saturn V Rocket and its different stages were spread across one giant room.
