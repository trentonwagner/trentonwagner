The JDI offers students of all levels of debate experience the opportunity to further their development through a low student-to-staff ratio and interaction with exceptional faculty.

## My Take

I did this camp before my sophomore year in high school. It was two weeks long and during the two weeks we learned about that year's debate resolution. We also did a camp wide debate tournament. This camp made me realize that, while I like debate from a casual standpoint, I didn't have the desire to debate at a higher competitive level. I am still doing debate and forensics because I enjoy the company of the other people in the program and the academic exercise of policy debate.

To learn more about this camp, you can find it on the [**Kansas University Website**](https://debate.ku.edu/debate-camp-info).
