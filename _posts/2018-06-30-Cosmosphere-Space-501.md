## My Take

During this camp, I went to California. While we were there we got to see the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Mission Control for the Opportunity Rover. I got to sit in the chairs of the Mission Control and I got to see what was happening to the rover in real time. I also toured a military base with a two-mile-long runway for space missions that went wrong. Overall, it was a lot of fun.
