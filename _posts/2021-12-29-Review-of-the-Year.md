## Aquaponics System

As some of you may know, I took my aquaponics system to the University of Kansas. It resides in the Spahr Engineering library where the Student Organization I founded acquired a room to use to hold the system. While there, I had several harvests, including one harvest of lettuce, two harvests of banana peppers and one harvest of one red pepper. All of the produce from my system was either given to friends or eaten by myself. The lettuce grew incredibly fast in the system and it seemed like it would love to continue to grow for as long as there is water and nutrients in the system.

In the end, the lettuce was the fastest growing plant that I had grown.

## Produce

The system overall was very productive. The lettuce exploded throughout the entire system while the peppers just kind of stayed in one spot. For the harvests, there will be some pictures below about that. There was so much lettuce and banana peppers. They seemed to like the system the most. There was a single bell pepper because the plant didn't seem to be very happy in the system. The jalapeno plant never recovered from the move, it was stressed and dwindled until it had no more leaves left.

## Fishy Updates

On a sad note, Tank died during the year. I was away from the system on a trip with my family and I came back and the system was about 90Â°F. He was the biggest fish and he couldn't move around the system to keep himself away from the majority of the heat and he passed away. The rest of the fish are doing well and survived the ordeal.

## Up Next

I am unsure as to when or what the next post will be as I have been slacking on posting to this blog.
