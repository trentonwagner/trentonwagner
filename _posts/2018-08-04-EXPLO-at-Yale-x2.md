## My Take

This camp I did two other courses. The first course was Engineering. During this course, we made a Rube Goldberg Machine to spell out Explo. While it took the whole last week of camp, most of the parts didn't work. The second course, was Physics. I learned that an object's inertia can make it so that if I put a heavy block of iron ontop of my hand and hit it with a hammer, as hard as I could, it wouldn't hurt. One of the side courses I took was Geocaching. This was a lot of fun because we got to trek through nature. My weekend trips this time were the Beach, which was very cold, and White-Water Rafting, which was amazing because we got soaked and got to eat a bunch of food halfway through.
