## When did you know?

The first time I knew was when I was a young kid in elementary school. My family traveled several hours and when we got out of the car, I was struck by rockets taller than a building, seeming to go up forever. When walking inside, there was a giant shuttle that greeted you, running from one side of the building far back to the other side. As we went on, I loved the rovers with boxes full of gadgets. There were so many different parts that all had to be in perfect sync to make them work. I was intrigued by their complexity, falling instantly in love with spacecraft and by extension, space itself, from my first visit to the [Cosmosphere](https://cosmo.org) in Hutchinson, Kansas.

I’ve had the opportunity over several years to attend [summer camps](https://cosmo.org/education/camps) offered from the Cosmosphere. Each space camp level has a different ‘mission’ and teaches kids how to work together, doing different tasks, to achieve very difficult goals that no single person could do alone. Like those shuttles and rovers, all of the different kids with different tasks had to work in sync. The first two camps ran missions in a mock space shuttle in Hutchinson. We had to go from takeoff to landing in the shuttle while also doing some experiments in space. In the third camp, we went to Houston to view the Johnson Space Center and we got to go into Mission Control for the Apollo Missions. The fourth camp took us to Florida to the Kennedy Space Center. During this camp, we launched a Weather Balloon into the atmosphere, we predicted where it would land and put science experiments on board the balloon. I personally worked on the parachute of the balloon so it would land safely back on the ground. The fifth camp took us to the Jet Propulsion Lab in California. We walked into the mission control where the Opportunity Rover was controlled and we saw the Rover being controlled on Mars in real time. Each of these experiences have felt life changing and further reinforces my love for space, engineering, and robotics.

Space is very exciting, with so much still unknown and waiting to be discovered. Space also presents many challenges that cannot be overcome by one person alone. Through this sort of monumental [world-wide collaboration](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/news/black-hole-image-makes-history), we’ve recently been given the gift of actually seeing what a black hole looks like. This is the kind of thing I really want to be a part of in my life, whether it is helping to build the next Rover, discovering new planets around distant stars, or some currently unknown discovery waiting around the corner.

That first Cosmosphere visit so many years ago and space camps ignited a spark of curiosity and intrigue for me that has helped me find my passion. Stars, black holes, space shuttles, rovers, and rockets have so many interesting things to learn about. Because of the Cosmosphere, I know that I love space and everything in it.
