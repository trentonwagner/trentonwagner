## My Take

In this camp I helped run a mock Kansas government. My job was in the Department of Natural Resources, which gave out grants to help people utilize their natural resources. I learned how to work and get along with people who I don't agree with and how budgeting works in a city/government. I made some really good friends at this camp as well.

To learn more about this camp, you can find it on the [**Kansas Boys State Website**](http://kansasboysstate.com).
