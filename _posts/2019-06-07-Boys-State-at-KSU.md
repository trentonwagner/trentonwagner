## My Take

This camp has a much more robotics in space theme. The mission had 1 aspect of us building components underwater while scuba diving. This simulated weighlessness of space. Another part of the mission was working with remote controlling the 'Canadarm', a robotic arm on the outside of the space station. We also launched rockets that we built.

To learn more about this camp, you can find it on the [**Kansas Boys State Website**](http://kansasboysstate.com).
