## Train like an Astronaut

> Campers learn the critical roles of both the astronauts and Mission Controllers as they prepare for their own space mission aboard the Cosmosphereâ€™s Falcon III spacecraft simulator. Train like real astronauts using a Soyuz capsule replica with actual interior used by real NASA astronauts, our 4-G centrifuge, multi-axis trainer and stress simulator. Engage with rocket engineering history through artifacts found only at the Cosmosphere and build rockets including a model V2.

## My Take

There was a mock shuttle and we split up into groups. Each group had several different roles. We spent all week practiciting for the mission. I was **Pilot** for my group. We went on a 4G centerfuge, toured and learned about different space history, and watched a show in the planentarium.
