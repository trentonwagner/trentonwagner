## ADVANCED ASTRONAUT TRAINING

> Fly an advanced Falcon lll spacecraft simulator mission to service the Hubble space telescope; train like real astronauts using a Soyuz capsule replica with actual interior used by real NASA astronauts, our 4-G centrifuge, multi-axis trainer and stress simulator; engage with rocket engineering history through artifacts found only at the Cosmosphere and train for microgravity environments with a SCUBA experience.

## My Take

This camp has a much more robotics in space theme. The mission had 1 aspect of us building components underwater while scuba diving. This simulated weighlessness of space. Another part of the mission was working with remote controlling the 'Canadarm', a robotic arm on the outside of the space station. We also launched rockets that we built.
