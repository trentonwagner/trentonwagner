## The Pests

Recently, I have seen several small gnats and fruit flies flying around the media garden. They were bothering me, so I decided to research solutions on how to get rid of them.

## The Solution

There were several different suggestions by Dr. Google, including apple cider vinegar with a couple of drops of dish soap in a container covered with plastic wrap with small holes in it. The plastic wrap keeps the flies in the container without letting them escape. The dish soap breaks the surface tension of the vinegar which makes the flies sink into the vinegar and drown.

## Fishies

The fish all seem do be doing very well and they are all growing pretty fast. The sucker fish is still alive and is actually getting pretty large. I have taught the fish to eat from my fingers, and I think it is super adorable.

## Up Next

I would like to setup sensors and devices to monitor and notify about the readings. These devices would be IoT devices. Internet of Thing (IoT) devices are connected wirelessly to the internet, allowing me to monitor my system without being there in person either by phone app or browser. When I get these researched and set up, I will put a link to the website for the readings of my system. Stay tuned for more!
